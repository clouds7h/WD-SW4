## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Description of the project in details. <br> <br>
The project involves creating a landing page and 2 feature pages. For this project I created a landing page that has a Jujutsu Kaisen theme. It consists of a header that contains navigation buttons and the JJK logo and a card containing the needed info for the project. 
The nav bar contains buttons that leads to the 2 features pages. The first feature page is Kyoto Jujutsu High page. The contents of the header is the same as the landing page as it is the same across all pages. Below the header is a hero image used as background. Below it is an about us section containing more details about Kyoto Jujutsu High. For the Sorceres page, you would see the same header from the landing page. You would also see an image slider containg images and info about the sorceres studying in Jujutsu High. I also added an animation for the content that would be displayed in each slide. For the icons used in the image slider buttons, I got it from the Font Awesome icons library. <br> <br>
For the landing page and jujutsu high page, I maximized the use of HTML and CSS. As for the sorceres page, since I have an image slider I added a JS file. As for the design, I made sure that the theme of Jujutsu Kaisen would be carried out across all pages. Some key parts is the red border for the buttons as well as the dark backgrounds in the pages. <br> <br>

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
