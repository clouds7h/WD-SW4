                    <div class="des">Gojo Satoru's Limitless technique is a rare and immensely powerful ability in "Jujutsu Kaisen," 
                        granting him unparalleled control over spatial manipulation. This technique allows Gojo to manipulate the 
                        space around him in various ways, giving him a significant edge in combat. He can create barriers that are 
                        nearly impenetrable, distort space to redirect attacks, and teleport himself and others over vast distances in an 
                        instant. The Limitless technique also enables Gojo to compress or expand space at will, altering the battlefield to his 
                        advantage and confounding his opponents with unpredictable movements. This mastery over spatial manipulation not only 
                        enhances his defensive capabilities but also amplifies the force and precision of his offensive strikes, making Gojo 
                        Satoru a fearsome and virtually invincible adversary in the world of jujutsu sorcery. His skill with the Limitless technique 
                        is pivotal in maintaining balance and protecting humanity from the supernatural threats that plague the series.</div>
