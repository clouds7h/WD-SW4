            <h1>Jujutsu Kaisen</h1>
            <p>"Jujutsu Kaisen" unfolds in a universe where malevolent Cursed Spirits prey on unsuspecting humans, and fragments of the feared demon 
                Ryomen Sukuna are dispersed and hidden. If any curse were to consume Sukuna's body parts, they would amass power capable of catastrophic 
                destruction. Thankfully, a secretive school of Jujutsu Sorcerers stands ready to safeguard humanity from these otherworldly threats, 
                preserving the delicate balance between the living and the supernatural.</p>
